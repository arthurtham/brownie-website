    <h2>Sub Perks</h2>
    <p>Subbing on Twitch is the best way to support me. Sub money goes back to the stream and my game dev endeavors.</p>
    <p>In addition, by linking your Twitch account to Discord and subscribing to me, you will get the following perks:
    <ul>
        <li>Use my Twitch emotes across all servers.</li>
        <li>When I work on a personal project, you can read my dev log on my sub blog.</li>
        <li>Follow me on my adventures via the travel blogs!</li>
        <li>You will gain access to an exclusive text channel to chat with other subs!</li>
        <li>In some cases, I will prioritize subs to join me for games on stream.</li>
        <li>You can get access to more perks as they get implemented!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>VIPs and mods also get sub perks regardless of if they subbed or not.</p>
